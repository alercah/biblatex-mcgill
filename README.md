This is hopefully someday going to be a BibLaTeX package to do citations
following the *McGill Guide to Uniform Legal Citation*, used in the legal
field in Canada.

Unfortunately, legal citation is extremely complicated.

So for the time being this is a WIP. If you're interested in looking at it,
note that as of this writing, a lot of the code for citing cases works 
(the `jurisprudence` entrytype), but there is no code specific for other
entrytypes so it will probably make your bibliography worse.

Requires Biber 2.20 or higher.
